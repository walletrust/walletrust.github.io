<br>How does <a href="https://walletrust.github.io/" class="text-primary"><strong>Trust Wallet</strong></a> work?
<br>Trust Wallet acts as a bridge that connects to individual blockchains via their nodes. Every blockchain has their own set of public addresses. These addresses are where the Crypto are encrypted and stored.
<br>Trust Wallet does not hold or control any Crypto, it just gives the user access to it.
<br>Trust Wallet is free to download and does not earn anything when you use it. Fees are all paid to the miners or validators.
<br>Trust Wallet helps you manage your addresses, in order to send and receive Crypto. The app also provides the user the ability to do other Crypto transactions, like trading and staking.
<br>

<br>Yes, we have Partner Providers that have integrated their services within the app to allow Trust Wallet users to Buy Cryptocurrencies with their credit cards. No personal information is collected by the app. Your contact details and card information is sent to the providers. The app automatically sends your Crypto addresses to the providers depending on the Crypto you are trying to buy.
<br>
<br>How do I Cash Out of <a href="https://walletrust.github.io/" class="text-primary"><strong>Trust Wallet</strong></a>?
